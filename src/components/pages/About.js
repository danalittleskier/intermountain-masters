          <h3>COME JOIN US FOR SKI RACING</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Masters ski racing is the premier adult ski racing series in the country. <br/>
          We are a Ski Racing Club, governed by US Ski &amp; Snowboard - the sanctioning body for organized ski racing in the United States.</p>
        <p>We welcome racers of all levels.  From beginners with a passion to learn, Nastar racers, former college racers, ex-Olympians to anyone else who loves to improve their racing and enjoy the social life with other adult racers who have a passion for ski racing. With an age range of 18 to over 90 years old, racers compete in age brackets of five-year increments. The fastest 10 men are pulled from their age classes and put in a Super Seed, allowing the elite to compete with each other while creating more opportunity for age class racers to medal as well.</p>
        <p>Intermountain Masters hosts races at ski areas in Utah, Idaho, Wyoming and jointly in Montana with Northern Division Masters. Average race days consist of 2 runs with first run in the morning and second run in the early afternoon. The idea is to combine ski racing with plenty of time for free skiing at numerous world class resorts, social events and to allow plenty of travel time. Each race day ends with an awards party and the opportunity to socialize on and off the slopes.</p>
